# Python notes 
## 1) Fundamentals  

- Interpreted not compiled.
- A collection of functions make a module.
- Funtions + modules = standard library 

-	Python is batteries included.
    Python standard library https://docs.python.org/3/library/


-	Suites are blocks of code.
-	: colon, introduce a suite of code that must be indented to the right.
-	Else if , in python is elif (Condition) : 
-	>>> python shell
-	Everything is an object in python any object can be assigned to a variable.
-	Python is sort of object oriented, more precise object–based.


## 2)Ordered Data 

python comes wiht four build data structures 

2.2 list
An ordered mutable collection of objects ( similar to an array in other languages)

They are dynamic, can grown and shrink on demand, no need to pre declare the size 
heterogenous: you can mix’n’match objects of different types.
As with an array slots are numbered from zero upwards these are index values.

odds = [1,3,5,7,9]


2.3 Tuple
An ordered immutable collection of objects 
a tuple is a constant list 

2.4 Dictionary 
Is an unordered set of key/value pairs 
are unordered and mutable 
they are two columned multirow data structures, 
can grow or shrink on demand 
the values associated with a key can be any object ( of any type )

2.5 Set 
can grow or shrink on demand 
ensure that non of the objects are not duplicated
